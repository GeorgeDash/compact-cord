## CompactCord
CompactCord is a customizable, *CSS only* (yup, that's right - just pure CSS) snippet that collapses certain parts of the Discord UI, and you customize each element individually.
I wanna thank @programmer2514 and his **BetterDiscord-CollapsibleUI** JS plugin for the inspiration! 🔥

And with that, I hope you enjoy my CSS snippet! ✨
